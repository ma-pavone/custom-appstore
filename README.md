# My Custom Runtipi Appstore

This repository is a customized fork of the **[Official Runtipi Appstore](https://github.com/runtipi/appstore)**.

While the original Runtipi Appstore provides a fantastic collection of applications, I've tailored this version to include apps that are particularly useful and relevant for my personal setup and workflow.

---

## What's Different Here?

You'll find a curated selection of apps specifically chosen to meet my needs. In addition to the great apps already available from Runtipi, I'll be adding my own **custom-developed applications** that integrate seamlessly with the Runtipi ecosystem.

---

## Why This Fork?

The goal of this fork is to:

* **Centralize my preferred Runtipi applications.**
* **Easily deploy and manage my custom-built apps.**
* **Share my custom applications with others (should they find them useful!).**

---

## Contributing (for my own reference)

While this is primarily a personal fork, I may occasionally merge updates from the official Runtipi Appstore to keep things current.

---

## Explore My Custom Apps!

Feel free to browse the `apps/` directory to see what custom applications I've added. Each app will have its own dedicated directory with a `README.md` file providing more details on its functionality and how to use it.
